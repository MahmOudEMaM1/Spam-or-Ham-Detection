# Spam-or-Ham-Detection Using BERT
This project is a Flask web application that uses a pre-trained BERT model to classify text messages as "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). It takes user input through a web form, processes the text using the BERT tokenizer, and then uses a fine-tuned BERT model for sequence classification to predict whether the message is spam or not. The model was trained and saved as bert_spam_classifier.pt.

- Key Features:

- Uses a BERT-based model for high-quality text classification.
- Simple web interface to input messages and get predictions.
- Built with Flask and PyTorch.
