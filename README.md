# ðŸ“¨ Flask Spam Classifier with BERT

## Objective
Develop a Flask web application that classifies text messages as "spam" or "ham" using a pre-trained BERT model.

## Tools
- **Flask**: Web framework for handling HTTP requests and rendering templates.
- **BERT (Transformers)**: For sequence classification (spam detection).
- **PyTorch**: For loading and running the pre-trained BERT model.
- **HTML/JavaScript**: For rendering the web interface and handling form submissions.

## Key Features
- **Spam Detection**: Classifies user-submitted text as either "spam" or "ham" using a pre-trained BERT model.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple form-based interface for submitting text for classification.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Provides instant feedback on whether the input message is spam or not.
- **Pre-Trained Model**: Uses the `bert-base-uncased` model with fine-tuning for spam detection.
